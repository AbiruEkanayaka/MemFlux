# Memory Management

MemFlux provides features to manage its memory usage, preventing the server from consuming more RAM than allocated. This is controlled primarily through the `maxmemory_mb` configuration setting.

## `maxmemory` Configuration

The `maxmemory_mb` option in `config.json` sets a hard limit on the total memory MemFlux will use for keys, values, and overhead.

-   **`"maxmemory_mb": 0` (Default):** Memory management is disabled. The server will consume as much memory as the operating system allows.
-   **`"maxmemory_mb": 1024`:** The server will limit its memory usage to 1024 MB (1 GB).

When this limit is enabled, MemFlux will actively monitor its estimated memory usage. If a new write command would cause the server to exceed the `maxmemory` limit, it will first attempt to free up space by evicting existing keys.

## Eviction Policy: LRU

MemFlux uses a **Least Recently Used (LRU)** eviction policy. This means that when memory needs to be freed, the server will delete the key that has not been accessed for the longest time.

-   **How it works:** The server maintains a list of keys in the order they were last accessed.
-   **Access:** Any read (`GET`, `JSON.GET`, etc.) or write (`SET`, `LPUSH`, etc.) operation on a key marks it as "recently used" by moving it to the front of the LRU list.
-   **Eviction:** When memory is full, keys are evicted from the tail of the listâ€”the ones that have been idle the longest.

This policy ensures that frequently accessed, "hot" data is likely to remain in memory, while "cold" data is evicted first.

## Monitoring Memory

You can check the current memory usage of the server at any time using the `MEMUSAGE` command.

```
> MEMUSAGE
:12345678
```

This returns the total memory used in bytes. This value is an estimate but is the same one used to check against the `maxmemory` limit.
